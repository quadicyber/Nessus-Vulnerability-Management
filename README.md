# Nessus Vulnerability Management

For this project I wanted to get some experience with vulnerability scanning and remediation, which 
are the two most important steps in the vulnerability management process. 

I made use of Nessus Essentials to scan some VMs I spun up in VirtualBox so I could run some 
credentialed scans to discover the vulnerabilities, and then scan agin to verify remediation steps. 

Here is a breakdown of what I did in bullet points:
- Installed Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed scans against a Windows 10 VM.
- Implemented vulnerability management functions on sandbox networks.
- Conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus and remediated vulnerabilities.
- Developed an automated remediation procedure to proactively deal with vulnerabilities associated with Windows updates and third party software.

## *Basic Network Port Scan*

For this step, I targeted the IP address of my VM and ran manual scans on them. Then I observed and recorded the results of each scan.

## *Credentialed Scans*
In order to commence the credentialed scans, I first had to configure both the Windows VM and Nessus. I'll spare the details, but this was overall a straightforward process that did not involve a ton of steps.

In order to force an increse in observed vulnerabilities, I installed a deprecated version of Mozilla Firefox and compared and contrasted the Before and After:

I then went ahead and implemented some of the recommended remediations, such as updating to the latest version of FireFox and manually checking for Windows updates and installing them. After a restart I ran another credentialed scan and got these results.

## *Conclusion*
As previously stated, the goal of this project was to get some experience with vulnerability management, credentialed scans, and remediations processes using Nessus. This was a very brief yet informative project that helped me put into practice what I have learned about in my cybersecurity journey.
